### museum-app

An exercise to practice api calls and async/await functions. I found the met museum open api which give access to departments and objects within these departments. So I decided to render a navigation menu with all of the departments, when the user clicks the department a random museum object will be displayed. An overlay displayed on hover of the object item displays the title and further description of the museum object. 

#### Skills demonstrated 
- async/await 
- api fetch
- sass 

#### ToDo 
- add search functionality to search for museum object by name 
- add loading... feature for user feeback if api call is slow 
- check for accessibility

### Reflections 
This is the first time to use async/await functions, I think the use of async allows my code to look a lot organised and clean, I will be using this format in the future. 
Also my first time implementing sass in any project, its great and will use going forward. I expecially like the ability to nest properties. There is a lot more to learn about sass too
